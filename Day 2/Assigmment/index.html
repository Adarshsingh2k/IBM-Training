            Subhash Chandra Bose Jayanti 2022: Subhash Chandra Bose, popularly known 
            as ‘Netaji’, is regarded as one of the most iconic Indian leaders and freedom fighters. 
            Born on January 23, 1897, Bose’s patriotism and iconic call for freedom made him a hero
             and earned him an indefatigable reputation since the Indian Independence movement.

            In the late 1920s, he led the young, radical wing of the Indian National
             Congress and in 1938, became the president of the party. Due to ideological 
             differences with Mahatma Gandhi, he was ousted. But that did not impact his
             continued struggle against the British. His death may be shrouded in mystery,
              but his legacy continues to inspire generations even today.

                <p>Subhas Chandra Bose believed that the Bhagavad Gita was a
                 great source of inspiration for the struggle against the British.
                  Swami Vivekananda's teachings on universalism, his nationalist thoughts and his emphasis
                   on social service and reform had all inspired Subhas Chandra Bose from his very young days.
                    The fresh interpretation of India's ancient scriptures had appealed immensely to him.[134]
                     Some scholars think that Hindu spirituality formed an essential part of his political and
                      social thought.[135] As historian Leonard Gordon explains "Inner religious explorations 
                      continued to be a part of his adult life. 
                This set him apart from the slowly growing number of atheistic socialists and communists who d
                otted the Indian landscape."</p>

                    Bose's correspondence (prior to 1939) reflects his disapproval of 
                    the racist practices and annulment of democratic institutions in Nazi 
                    Germany: "Today I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction
                     that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish but arrogant
                     ."[140] However, he expressed admiration for the authoritarian
                     methods which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s; 
                     he thought they could be used to build an independent India.[99]
                     Bose had clearly expressed his belief that democracy was the best option for 
                     India.[141] However, during the war (and possibly as early as the 1930s), 
                     Bose seems to have decided that no democratic system could be adequate to overcome India's poverty and social inequalities, 
                     and he wrote that a socialist state similar to that of Soviet Russia
